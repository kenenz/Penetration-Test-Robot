We are building an automated pen test robot in python. It must run as an asynchronous program. It will ask for the pen test target. As input it will accept an IP address, a range of IP addressess in CIDR format, or a domain name. It will search for active hosts using nmap. active hosts, their IP address, and their active ports will be stored in a file named TARGETS.txt. for each active host, it will check port 3389 and port 22. If port 3389 is active, start an RDP brute force attack using hydra. If port 22 is active, start a SSH brute force attack using hydra. If a brute force attack is successful the IP address, port, service and credentials will be saved in a file named BRUTEFORCE.txt. generate the python code for this program also add helpful comments in the code.
